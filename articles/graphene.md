ABSTRACT: Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are ideal systems for investigating fundamental properties in one-dimensional electronic systems and
have the potential to revolutionize many aspects of nano/molecular electronics.
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been used to characterize the atomic structure and tunneling density of states of individual SWNTs. Detailed
spectroscopic measurements showed one-dimensional singularities in the
SWNT density of states for both metallic and semiconducting nanotubes. The
results obtained were compared to and agree well with theoretical predictions
and tight-binding calculations. SWNTs were also shortened using the STM to
explore the role of finite size, which might be exploited for device applications.
Segments less than 10 nm exhibited discrete peaks in their tunneling spectra,
which correspond to quantized energy levels, and whose spacing scales inversely with length. Finally, the interaction between magnetic impurities and electrons confined to one dimension was studied by spatially resolving the local
electronic density of states of small cobalt clusters on metallic SWNTs. Spectroscopic measurements performed on and near these clusters exhibited a narrow peak near the Fermi level that has been identified as a Kondo resonance.
In addition, spectroscopic studies of ultrasmall magnetic nanostructures, consisting of small cobalt clusters on short nanotube pieces, exhibited features
characteristic of the bulk Kondo resonance, but also new features due to their
finite size.

Graphene nanotubes, or single wall carbon nanotubes, are graphene sheets rolled into a tube. Their unique physical properties make them a universal additive that can be used in 70% of all base materials to improve their specific properties.

Despite the similarity in their names, single wall and multi wall carbon nanotubes differ in their properties and in the effects they have on materials, just like graphene (a single layer of carbon atoms) differs from graphite (multiple layers of carbon atoms
